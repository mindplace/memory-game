# Questions

* Can I use this card-flip dependency https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-flipcard (I'd like to spend the most time in the game logic and with React)


# Plan

- [x] Initialize a deck of cards with all the suits
- [x] Ensure deck of cards is shuffled on loading new game
- [x] Initialize cards as components and render to the page
- [x] Card and board styles
- [ ] Add onClick flip
- [ ] Track number of found pairs
- [ ] Add winning conditions
- [ ] Add scoring
- [ ] Three-card version functionality
- [ ] Using cookies to save game progress ??
